"""
Simulates writings from simplescalar to the memory content file

Waits for dram simulator to delete the memory file.
Uses backup_memory.txt file to get random lines that are true acceses from
simplescalar and writes it to a file. Therefore, backup_memory.txt should have
something like: "64 r 536440832 39"

Finally reads signal file and deletes it.

This process is the same followed between simplescalar and the dram simulator
